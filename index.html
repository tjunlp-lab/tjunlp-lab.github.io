<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  At TJUNLP, we are dedicated to advancing the frontiers of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our research is organized into specialized groups focusing on key areas:
  <ul>
    <!-- <li><strong>LLM Development</strong>: Pre-training, fine-tuning (SFT, DPO, PPO, GRPO), training data enhancement, model quantization, and optimization for general and domain-specific LLMs (e.g., code and DNA models).</li> -->
    <li><strong>LLMs & Reasoning LMs</strong>: Full-stack LLM research, training data enhancement, model quantization, optimization for general and domain-specific LLMs, CoT, new approaches to reasoning LMs.</li>
    <li><strong>Multilingual NLP</strong>: Research on multilingual datasets, fine-tuning, alignment, evaluation, translation, and cross-lingual adaptation for low-resource languages.</li>
    <li><strong>LLM Interpretability & Safety</strong>: Model editing, neuron analysis, concept alignment, AI safety, privacy protection, backdoor detection, and adversarial robustness.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation & Data Synthesis</strong>: Multi-dimensional evaluation of LLMs, synthetic data generation, and benchmarking for large-scale NLP models.</li>
    <li><strong>LLM-powered Agents & RAG </strong>: Developing intelligent agents with enhanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities, optimizing RAG for knowledge retrieval and generation.</li>
    <li><strong>AI for Science </strong>: Applying AI to solve complex scientific challenges, including DNA modeling and AI-driven scientific discovery.</li>
  </ul>
  Through these research areas, TJUNLP aims to push the boundaries of AI, enhance multilingual communication, improve model reliability, and explore AI-driven scientific advancements.
